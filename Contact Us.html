		 <h1> About Us</h1>
		 <p> I've always been passionate about animals. I was a vet tech for years although I am moving from that field to IT. My passion is still the same. With that and volunteering at animal rescues, it has always been on my mind abut the difference between rescues and animal shelter. The cat cafe will be a safe having for exclusively black cats that have trouble getting adopted. I have researed my city's local animal shelter before adopting my baby. This animal shelter and like others must take all animals that are turn into them and with little room, animals that have aged in the shelter or aged in general, are unforunately euthanized. Our cafe mission to save as many lives as possible.</p>
